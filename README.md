# Python App Demo

## Setup
1. Create a Virtual Environment `python-app-demo`

```bash
conda create -n python-app-demo python==3.11.7
```

2. Use that environment

```bash
conda activate python-app-demo
```

3. Install `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Building Dockerfile

Check Python images here
https://hub.docker.com/_/python/tags

Chosen version
```
3.11-slim
```

You can try if the image exists in Podman by

```bash
podman pull python:3.13-alpine
```

Check the images if it exists.

```bash
podman images
```

5. Building the Docker Image

```bash
podman build -t python-app:v1 .
```

Check the new list of images

```bash
podman images
```

6. Run the image

This is not working as intended

```bash
podman run -p 8080:5000 python-app:v1
```

```bash
podman ps
```

```bash
podman exec -ti [CONTAINER_ID] sh
```

Install CURL if not available

```bash
apk update  # if the container is based on Alpine Linux
apk add curl  # if the container is based on Alpine Linux
apt update  # if the container is based on Debian or Ubuntu
apt install curl  # if the container is based on Debian or Ubuntu
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/healthz
```

Upon running the command above, we can see that the API is running, we can access the endpoints inside of the container but we cannot access it outside.

```bash
/ # curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/healthz
{"status":"up"}
```

The reason is that only the local interface is exposed, answer

```

Modify `app.run`

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0"
```


With the new changes build a new image with tag `v2`

```bash
podman build -t python-app:v2 .
```

```bash
podman run -p 8080:5000 python-app:v2
```
